# Linear Regression on Ames Housing Price Dataset

### Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. The dataset provides comprehensive real estate data, and this project aims to analyze and model housing prices based on various features.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing Dataset, which contains detailed information on residential properties in Ames, Iowa. It includes various features such as:

- Lot Area
- Year Built
- Overall Quality
- Total Basement Area
- Garage Area
- Number of Bathrooms
  And more...

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Features & Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Model Training: Implementing and training a Linear Regression model.
Evaluation: Using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared score to assess model performance.

### Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook 01_LinearRegression-AmesHousingPrice.ipynb
Run each cell sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate performance.
Modify features or hyperparameters as needed for better performance.

### Results

The Linear Regression model predicts housing prices with reasonable accuracy. Further improvements can be made by incorporating feature engineering and advanced regression techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, or Polynomial Regression.
